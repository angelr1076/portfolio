            Driven by a childhood curiosity to understand how things work, I've
            always been passionate about deconstructing and reassembling the
            world around me.

            At Ethos Therapy Solutions, I designed and implemented a SharePoint
            migration that saved over $90,000, built mapping systems to improve
            logistics, and developed internal apps that reduced support
            overhead. I focus on designing systems that are clear, reliable, and
            built to serve real-world needs.
          </p>

            Today, I build solutions that help people focus on meaningful work,
            not get bogged down by broken processes. I'm committed to refining
            my craft, staying curious, and continuing to grow as a developer
            throughout my career.
